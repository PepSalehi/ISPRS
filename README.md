The open data challenge is organized by ISPRS WGII/7: Intelligent Spatial Decision Support and sponsored by Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Spatial Smart Sensing and Services, Shenzhen University. It aims at promoting research and excellent work on open data, and encourages creative ideas. Over one million AFC data collected by transit smart cards in a metropolis area will be provided, together with some bus GPS trajectories. Participants will be required to identify bus stops, passenger alighting stations, and then finish a project using the data with open software.
